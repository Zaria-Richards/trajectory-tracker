# 🛰️ Trajectory Tracker
A data analysis and prediction project inspired by how aerospace and defense systems track moving objects.  
Uses real flight/satellite data to model motion paths and forecast future positions.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, Matplotlib/Plotly, Scikit-learn

## 📁 Dataset
Source -> OpenSky Aircraft States Snapshot:
Live aircraft positions and kinematics from OpenSky

Description: Tracks real-time motion data (e.g., latitude, longitude, altitude, timestamp)

## 🚀 Objectives
- Analyze motion trajectory data
- Predict next coordinates using regression
- Visualize actual vs predicted paths
- Explore noise filtering for realistic tracking

## 🧠 Learning Goals
- Understand time-series motion data
- Build simple predictive models
- Practice data visualization and storytelling
